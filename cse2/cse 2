    <p>We define peace through the following four components:

        Peace is an outcome (e.g., it is assessed by the absence or cessation of violence).
        Peace is a process (e.g., peacebuilding is characterized by efforts to negotiate freedom from violence through the creation of social bonds within and across groups of people.)
        Peace is a human disposition (e.e., it is a personal and social orientation to secure freedom from distress and to foster a capacity to act, predicated on a fundamental recognition of freedom and dignity of all people).
        Peace is a culture (i.e., it is distinctive from a culture of violence, and fosters a sense of global citizenship.)</p>
